# Generating-New-Dwight-Shrute-Quotes-using-LSTM-and-GPT-2


## Motivation:
The idea behind this project is to build LSTM model and finetune GPT-2 on our dataset of dwight shrute quotes to generate new unseen quotes in the same style and context as that of Dwight Shrute. We have compare the performance of these models and how each of them would capture the context, style and, length of the quotes.

## Methodology:
We have performed various data pre processing steps to preprare the dataset for the models. We have then tested out 3 different models - Markov chain models, LSTM , and GPT-2 and compare the performance.

## Results:

New Quotes generated by the models:

GPT-2 : 

**It is my job to see what is written and to look at it. If it is not corrected in a timely fashion, I
will fire her.**

Markov Model:
SEED: To Sell 
Output: To Sell More More Paper.

LSTM:

That 's luka. Whacking moles, take in here Michael us got here.


##Evaluation:

We have used the perplexity scores to evaluate the models performance and compare them.
